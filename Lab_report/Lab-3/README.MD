#  OBJECTIVE:JAVASCRIPT FUNDAMENTAL
1) WAP to reverse the string provided by the users.</br>
2)  Write a function to check if the provided number is palindromic or not.</br>
3)  Write the program to find the sum of prime number between 1 and 50.</br>
4)  Write a function that reverse the provided array.</br>
5) Write a function that sort the provided array based on the parameter(i.e. asc=ascending, desc=descending order)

# THEORY:
alert()
Using alert displays a dialog with given message .The dialog gets closed on clicking "OK" button.

alert("HELLO");

prompt()
Using prompt , we can retrieve inputs from the user.

let name = prompt("Enter Your Name :");

console.log()
This function allows us to log into the browser console and helps us to debug our code easily.

console.log("Child element is displayed !");

## CODES:
## CONCLUSION:
In this way we can reverse string and array, find the order of given digits, find sum of given digits, find if a number is palindrome or not and also find the order using java script.
